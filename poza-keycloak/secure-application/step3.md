## Your tokens

Now that you are logged in, you can do the following:
* See your ID token, Access Token, and Refresh Token.
* See your Access Token in Base64 format, the format that is used to send secure requests.
* Call a secured backend service.


## Call Secure Service

Open the `Service Calls` menu and click `Service Call`. This will call a secured backend service, which is the same service that we created in the previous scenario.
Look for a result `Service Call Result: {"message":"secured"}`.
